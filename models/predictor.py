### Detailed Pricing Strategy for Your Project

Based on your project parameters (IR: {ir}%, LOI: {loi} min, Sample Size: {completes}) and our prediction of ${predicted_cpi:.2f}, we've developed the following strategic recommendations:

#### Pricing Position
Your predicted CPI of ${predicted_cpi:.2f} falls in the **{zone}** pricing zone. This places your bid at the {won_percentile:.0f}th percentile of similar won bids, meaning that {won_percentile:.0f}% of similar won projects were priced below your predicted CPI.

#### Parameter-Specific Insights

**Incidence Rate (IR) Considerations:**
{ir_advice}

**Length of Interview (LOI) Considerations:**
{loi_advice}

**Sample Size Considerations:**
{completes_advice}

#### Competitive Analysis
Among similar projects to yours, we've found:
- Average CPI for won bids: ${similar_won_avg:.2f} (based on {similar_won_count} similar projects)
- Average CPI for lost bids: ${similar_lost_avg:.2f} (based on {similar_lost_count} similar projects)
- Your prediction is {((predicted_cpi - similar_won_avg) / similar_won_avg * 100):+.1f}% compared to similar won bids

#### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Primary Recommendation**: Consider a CPI of ${min(predicted_cpi, similar_won_avg * 1.05):.2f} to optimize balance between win probability and profitability
2. **For Higher Win Probability**: A CPI of ${similar_won_avg * 0.95:.2f} would significantly increase win likelihood
3. **For Higher Margin**: If project is desirable but not critical, a CPI of ${min(predicted_cpi * 1.1, similar_lost_avg * 0.95):.2f} would improve profitability while maintaining reasonable win chances

Remember that pricing should be considered alongside other competitive factors such as speed of delivery, quality of sample, and client relationship value.
