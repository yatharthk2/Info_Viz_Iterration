Error handling: Add more robust error handling, especially for data loading. Currently, if files are missing, the app will crash.
Configuration management: Move hardcoded values (file paths, bin sizes, etc.) to a configuration file.
Testing: Add unit tests to ensure data processing and model functions work as expected.
Code documentation: Add more comprehensive docstrings to functions.

Data Processing Improvements

Data validation: Add checks to validate the input data before processing.
Feature engineering: Consider adding more derived features for the prediction models, such as:

IR Ã— LOI interaction term
Log transformations of skewed variables
Country-specific features


Data caching: Implement Streamlit's caching to improve performance.

UI/UX Improvements

Loading indicators: Add progress bars for time-consuming operations.
Tooltips: Add explanatory tooltips for technical terms and charts.
Responsive design: Ensure the layout works well on different screen sizes.
Downloadable reports: Add ability to export analyses as PDF or Excel.
User feedback: Add a feedback mechanism for users to report issues.

Machine Learning Improvements

Model selection: Add more model types and a model comparison view.
Hyperparameter tuning: Implement grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.
Cross-validation: Use k-fold cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
Model explainability: Add SHAP value plots to explain model predictions (the package is already in requirements.txt).
Model persistence: Save trained models to disk to avoid retraining on startup.

User-Centered Improvements

User onboarding: Add a quick tutorial or "how to use" guide.
Customizable analyses: Allow users to select which factors to include in analyses.
User preferences: Save user preferences (filters, chart selections) between sessions.
Batch processing: Add ability to upload and analyze multiple files at once.

Performance Improvements

Data preprocessing optimization: Improve the efficiency of data loading and preprocessing.
Lazy loading: Only load components when needed.
Memory management: Optimize memory usage for large datasets.
