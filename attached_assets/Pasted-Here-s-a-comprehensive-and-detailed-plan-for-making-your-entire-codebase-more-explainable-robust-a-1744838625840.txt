Here’s a comprehensive and detailed plan for making your entire codebase more explainable, robust, and transparent, tailored to your current structure in #d:\Info-Viz\BidPricingAnalytics. This plan covers data quality, feature engineering, modeling, metrics, explainability, visualization, and workflow integration.

1. Data Quality & Preprocessing

1.1. Automated Data Checks

Use detect_data_issues to log and display:

Missing values (per column, with counts and percentages)

Outliers (using percentile, z-score, or IQR methods)

Zeros in critical columns (LOI, Completes)

Skewness (for CPI, IR, LOI, Completes)

Collinearity (highly correlated pairs)

Integrate these checks at the start of every data pipeline (in main.py and any data loading UI).

Visualize data issues in the dashboard (e.g., summary tables, warnings).

1.2. Outlier Handling

Apply handle_outliers to all numeric columns before feature engineering.

Log the number of outliers detected and capped/replaced.

1.3. Binning & Feature Engineering

Use apply_all_bins to create bins for IR, LOI, and Completes.

Leverage engineer_features to create:

Ratios (e.g., IR_LOI_Ratio, IR_Completes_Ratio)

Interaction terms (e.g., IR_LOI_Product)

Log transforms (e.g., Log_CPI, Log_Completes)

Efficiency metrics (e.g., CPI_Efficiency)

Cost per minute (CPI_per_Minute)

Document each engineered feature with comments and in user-facing documentation.

2. Model Preparation & Training

2.1. Data Preparation

Use prepare_model_data to:

Select relevant features (including engineered and binned features)

One-hot encode categorical variables (Type, Segment, Country, Audience)

Scale numeric features (using StandardScaler)

Remove rows with missing or invalid data

Log the shape and columns of the final feature matrix

2.2. Model Building

Use build_models to train multiple models:

Linear (Ridge, Huber)

Tree-based (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Enable hyperparameter tuning as needed.

Log model parameters and training status.

2.3. Cross-Validation & Model Assumptions

Use cross_validate_models to report:

MSE, RMSE, MAE, R² (mean and std across folds)

Use evaluate_model_assumptions to check:

Linearity

Residual normality

Homoscedasticity

Multicollinearity

Outliers in residuals

Display warnings or suggestions if assumptions are violated.

3. Model Explainability

3.1. Feature Importance

Extract feature importances from tree models (feature_importances_) and coefficients from linear models (coef_).

Visualize using create_feature_importance_chart and display in the dashboard.

3.2. Prediction Metrics

Use get_prediction_metrics to summarize prediction spread:

Min, max, mean, median, std of predictions

Display these metrics alongside model outputs.

3.3. Advanced Explainability (Optional)

Integrate SHAP or LIME for local and global explanations:Show per-prediction feature contributions

Visualize SHAP summary plots for top features

4. Performance Metrics & Reporting

4.1. Regression Metrics

Always report MSE, RMSE, MAE, R² for each model (already in model_scores).

Show these metrics in the sidebar, output pane, or results dashboard.

4.2. Aggregate & Group Metrics

Use get_data_summary for group-level stats:

Mean, median, percentiles by bin or segment

4.3. Scenario Analysis

Use scenario tables and recommendations in show_insights for business context and what-if analysis.

5. Visualization & User Interface

5.1. Data Distribution

Visualize distributions with boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots (see utils/visualization.py, components/analysis.py).

5.2. Multi-factor Analysis

Use heatmaps and 3D plots to show combined effects of multiple features.

5.3. Feature Importance & Prediction Comparison

Visualize with dedicated charts after each model run.

5.4. Data Quality Reporting

Display detected data issues and warnings in the dashboard.

6. Documentation & Workflow Integration

6.1. Pipeline Steps

Data Loading: Load and sample data, run detect_data_issues.

Preprocessing: Handle outliers, binning, feature engineering.

Data Preparation: Prepare model matrix and target.

Model Training: Train and validate models.

Assumption Checks: Run model diagnostics.

Prediction & Explainability: Output predictions, metrics, feature importances.

Scenario Analysis: Provide business insights and recommendations.

Reporting: Visualize and log all results and issues.

6.2. Documentation

Comment all new features and steps in code.

Maintain a README or dashboard section explaining each metric, feature, and model.

7. Continuous Improvement

Feedback Loop: Regularly update models and features based on new data and business/user feedback.

Monitor Data Drift: Use data quality checks to detect changes in data distribution over time.

Expand Explainability: Integrate more advanced tools (e.g., SHAP) as needed.

8. Example: End-to-End Workflow Script

Would you like a sample script that ties these steps together, or help integrating any specific part into your dashboard or codebase?
